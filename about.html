       <h1 class="text-center">About me</h1>
    <h2 class="text-center">Certified IELTS trainer, ESL and FLE (FranÃ§ais Langue Ã‰trangÃ¨re) teacher and translator based in Tehran, Iran</h2>
   <div class="paragraphs mb-5 text-center">
    <p>My name is Nadia Bayat and I am 32 years old. I started teaching English in 2011 in various English institutes in Tehran. While doing my first degree in French Language Interpretation and Translation at Alzahra University, I decided to change my career path and become a French teacher, too. I obtained a certificate in teaching French as a foreign language in 2016.</p>
    <p>After receiving my Master's degree in French Language Interpretation and Translation from University of Tehran in 2019, I decided to work as a freelancer and deliver online private lessons to students from around the world.</p>
    <p>I have been teaching both English and French to children, young and adult learners ever since. I also help students with IELTS and TEF (Test d'Ã©valuation du franÃ§ais) by practicing test skills through preparation courses to check students' progress in order to improve their actual language level to get the score they need.</p>
    <p>As a highly motivated, enthusiastic and creative teacher with a proven record of helping students progress, I provide positive learning experiences as well as treating peers equally in the same situation, with 10+ years of experience teaching different age groups and levels of students.</p>
    <p>Students can take advantage of this modern form of education and study online at their own pace. This is the reason why I became a virtual tutor to empower my students to become self-reliant learners. I am here to provide fun, engaging and relevant opprotunities that allow you to achieve accademic success. Let's make learning creative, flexible and challenging!</p>
